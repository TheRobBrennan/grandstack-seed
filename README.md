# GRANDstack seed

This GRANDStack ([GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com), [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com)) seed project contains built-in local authentication against a Neo4j back-end database - originally inspired by existing work from [@erikrahm](https://github.com/erikrahm) in the repo [https://github.com/erikrahm/grand-stack-seed](https://github.com/erikrahm/grand-stack-seed)

In order to get this project up and running on your development machine, you will need to:

+ Set up and configure a locally running instance of Neo4j
+ GraphQL server configuration
  + Define environment variables for the back-end GraphQL server

## Set up and configure a locally running instance of Neo4j

The easiest way to work with this project is to download and install the free [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/product/#desktop) for your development environment.

Once you have installed the free [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/product/#desktop), all you will need to do is:

+ Create a new project
+ Create a new graph database
+ Start the graph database
+ Launch the Neo4j browser

### Create a new project

After opening [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/product/#desktop), you will need to create a new project:

Let's create a new project with the name `GRANDstack seed`:

![screenshots/screenshot-01-example-of-grandstack-seed-project-after-creation.png](screenshots/screenshot-01-example-of-grandstack-seed-project-after-creation.png)

### Create a new graph database

Once a project has been created, you will then need to create a new graph database:

![screenshots/screenshot-03-create-a-local-graph.png](screenshots/screenshot-03-create-a-local-graph.png)

For this demo, I will create a new graph database with the following settings:

+ `Graph Name` - `GRANDstack seed`
+ `Set Password` - `letmein`
+ Use the latest version of the Neo4j database - Version `3.5.12` in this example

...wait a minute. What about the username? By default, [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com) will associate this password we're defining with a `neo4j` user account.

Once we click create, we will see:

#### Take a peek: Manage the graph database

If you click on `Manage` you will see a screen similar to:

![screenshots/screenshot-06-example-manage-the-graph-database.png](screenshots/screenshot-06-example-manage-the-graph-database.png)

### Start the graph database

Assuming we have created our graph database, we will see something like:

![screenshots/screenshot-05-manage-or-start-the-graph-database.png](screenshots/screenshot-05-manage-or-start-the-graph-database.png)

We will need to explicitly start/stop our graph database if we wish to use it ðŸ¤“

### Launch the Neo4j browser

With the graph database started, we can finally fire up the Neo4j Browser - a tool we will use for querying, visualizing, and interacting with our data:

Please see [Neo4j Browser User Interface Guide](https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/) for a great introductory video as well as a guide to working with this tool.

## GraphQL server configuration

Before you can run the GraphQL server, you will need to define a few environment variables for the application.

### Define environment variables for the back-end GraphQL server

For reference, I've created a sample `server/.env.sample` file that you can copy to `server/.env` and tweak as necessary.

The following environment variables must be defined in order for your GraphQL server to run:

```sh
# Neo4j
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=letmein

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=thisisabadsecrettousebutitworksforanexample
```

## Client application

For this project, we replaced the client originally supplied by the example code with a simple app.

### Client configuration

 1. This is just a basic Create React App (with typescript) that can be configured to your heart's content. (If you're unfamiliar with how to do this there are many resources available online.
 2. The app is wrapped in an `ApolloProvider` making your GraphQL server queriable throughout the app. This happens in `client/src/components/App.tsx`
 3. The app is also wrapped in a `BrowserRouter` from `react-router` and you can define your routes as you see fit.

- There is an authenticated route at `/` that can only be accessed once a user is logged in.

- There is a `/register` route that has some default styled form fields that handle user registration and a `/login` route to authenticate a user.

### [OPTIONAL] Generate a new create-react-app with TypeScript

To generate a new app using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) and [TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/):

```sh
$ npx create-react-app app --template typescript
```

## Seed project set-up

For reference, I've created a sample `server/.env.sample` file that you can copy to `server/.env` and tweak as necessary.


3. Install dependencies in the root and for both the server and client by running `npm install` in the root directory, followed by `npm run install-all` in the root directory.

4. Start  both servers by running `npm start` in the root of the project`

5. Start dev-ing!

## Project configuration

### Server configuration

1. There is a schema.graphql file that contains all of the app's type definitions and is run through a schema generator that converts Cypher queries (indicated by the `@cypher` or `@relationship` directives) into valid computed properties.
2. You can turn on automatic mutation generation on `line 44` of the `server/src/index.js` file and mutation on `line 45` (this will generate queries for all of your defined types, and add/update/delete mutations for all of your types as well) though I recommend writing your own resolvers or computed properties using the directives mentioned above as it will give you more fine-grained control over your application.
3. There is local authentication already built into the application, you can see this in action in the `server/src/resolvers.js` file.
4. You can create even more complex queries and mutations by leverage in the `neo4jgraphql` method that is exposed by `neo4j-graphql-js` package by mutating data passed into a query/mutation before it hits your neo4j database, you can see this in `server/src/resolvers.js` on `lines 8-12` where passwords are being hashed and salted by `bcrypt`
